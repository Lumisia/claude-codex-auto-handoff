## First Checks

- Make sure Claude Code and Codex are running in the same project folder.
- Run `/handoff status` to check whether this project has a waiting capsule.
- Run `/handoff recent` to check whether the capsule was saved under another project.
- Run `/handoff doctor` to diagnose storage, project identity, and capsule state.
- After changing settings, start a new session or run `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code.

The Claude Code monitor requires Claude Code v2.1.105 or newer, an interactive CLI session, and a user/personal-scope plugin install. If monitors are unavailable, the Stop hook still works after the current answer finishes.

## The Capsule Is Not Visible

Run `/handoff doctor` first. Most cases are one of these:

- You ran the tool from a different folder, so the project identity changed.
- The capsule was already resumed once and is now consumed.
- Claude Code and Codex are looking at different storage locations.
- In `ask` mode, capsule creation has not been approved yet.
- By default, a new session does not automatically fetch a capsule; run `/handoff`. Set `handoff.session_start_auto_fetch` to `true` only if you want SessionStart auto-fetch.

Suggested order:

```text
/handoff status
/handoff recent
/handoff history
/handoff doctor
```

If a capsule appears in `recent` but not in `status`, it is probably stored under a different project folder.

## Claude Code and Codex Do Not Connect

- Install the plugin in both tools.
- The plugin's internal name is `ai-handoff`.
- Claude Code reads usage from the status line; the plugin installs its statusline runner automatically on the first Claude Code session after install or reload.
- If the status line still does not update, run `/handoff doctor`. Claude
  project settings can override user settings. Run `/handoff doctor
  --fix-statusline` to reinstall the user statusline runner; if doctor still
  reports `claude-statusline-shadowed`, remove or adjust the higher-precedence
  `.claude/settings.local.json` or `.claude/settings.json` statusLine entry.
- Codex does not need extra status line setup.
- On Windows, the Store/MSIX Claude app can split `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. In that case, set `AI_HANDOFF_ROOT` to the same shared path for both tools.

On Windows, checking `AI_HANDOFF_ROOT` is usually the fastest first step when the tools cannot see each other's capsules.

## Storage Location and AI_HANDOFF_ROOT

If `AI_HANDOFF_ROOT` is set, ai-handoff uses that path. Otherwise it uses the OS default.

| OS | Default storage root |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai-handoff` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ai-handoff` |
| Linux | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/ai-handoff` or `~/.local/state/ai-handoff` |

Important subpaths:

| Data | Path |
|---|---|
| Settings | `<root>/config.json` |
| Project data | `<root>/projects/<fingerprint>` |
| Capsules | `<root>/projects/<fingerprint>/handoff` |
| Memory | `<root>/projects/<fingerprint>/memory` |
| Claude usage samples | `<root>/sensors/claude` |

Example shared storage on Windows:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AI_HANDOFF_ROOT", "C:\Users\<you>\ai-handoff-store", "User")
```

Example on macOS/Linux:

```bash
export AI_HANDOFF_ROOT="$HOME/ai-handoff-store"
```

Restart both Claude Code and Codex after changing the environment variable.

## Advanced Setting Keys

`/handoff config` shows the current settings. Values must match the expected type and range.

Clear old local handoff state with:

```text
/handoff clear used
/handoff clear used --older-than 7d
/handoff clear --older-than 7d
/handoff clear pending
/handoff clear this_project
/handoff clear this_project -c
```

`this_project` removes only this project's ai-handoff state folder, not the
source repository. Without `-c`, it returns a confirmation preview first.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `triggers.five_hour.burn_rate.enabled` | Prepare handoff earlier when usage is draining quickly |
| `triggers.five_hour.burn_rate.runway_minutes` | Prepare when estimated runway is below this many minutes, 5-120 |
| `capsule.completed_autocreate` | Create an automatic capsule even when the task looks complete |
| `clear.auto.enabled` | Automatically clear old used capsules on SessionStart |
| `clear.older_than_days` | Default age cutoff for clearing used capsules, default 30 |
| `handoff.notify_newer_pending` | Notify when a newer pending capsule exists |
| `handoff.session_start_auto_fetch` | Automatically inject and consume a pending capsule from SessionStart, default `false` |
| `locale` | Message language, `en`, `ko`, `ja`, `zh` |
| `debug.stop_log` | Write Stop hook decision logs |
| `memory.auto_recall` | Automatically recall verified memory at conversation start |
| `memory.auto_recall_token_budget` | Token budget for automatic memory recall |
| `statusline.show_handoff` | Show handoff information in the Claude status line |
| `notification.fallback` | Use terminal notification when OS notification fails |

Most users only need `threshold_percent`, `mode`, and `realtime.enabled`.
